# Chat with reTHINK

Simple Chat WebApp that takes advantage only of the features provided by the [reTHINK framework](https://rethink-project.github.io). This application allows the creation of chat rooms to exchange messages and the establishment of video calls between users. Each user is authenticated using their preferred IdP.

The view (UI) is out of scope of the reTHINK framework, so it was used the [Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com).

#### How to run

1.
```shell
npm install
```

2.
Encode the `dev-hyperty`folder using the [Hyperty-Toolkit](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-hyperty-toolkit). It is important to read its documentation first.

3.
```shell
node webServer.js
```
